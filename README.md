## API


## Methods

const users=db.createCollection('users');

users.find()

find method used to fetch 

__users.save()__  method allows you to insert one or more document into a collection.

users.delete({_id:'id'})

users.deleteAll()


## Limits

It is possible to experience performance issues when you have JavaScript objects larger than 10MB. When you call save(), the entire collection is serialized and written to storage.

ShellDb is recommended for low-load use cases and POC work. We recommend MongoDB for higher loads
